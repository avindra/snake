# Snake  [![Build Status](https://github.com/avindra/snake/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/avindra/snake/actions)

It is an implementation of the game of snake using reference JavaScript, and `<canvas>` for graphical output. The codebase uses Typescript (mostly for a handful of `interface` descriptions.)

There is experimental sound: unplug your headphones to rip beeps over your speakers.

## Development

A [`Makefile`](./Makefile) is included for convenience.

`esbuild` is used to build/bundle.

`deno` is used for unit testing.

 * run `make build` to build/bundle
 * run `make dev` to get a watch/recompile workflow (requires Python 3 for http server)
 * run [`deno test src`](https://deno.land/manual/testing#assertions) to run unit tests
   - Unit tests are co-located into src/
