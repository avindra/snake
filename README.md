# Snake  [![Build Status](https://github.com/avindra/snake/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/avindra/snake/actions)

It is an implementation of the game of snake using reference JavaScript, and `<canvas>` for graphical output. The codebase uses Typescript (mostly for a handful of `interface` descriptions.)

There is experimental sound: unplug your headphones to rip beeps over your speakers.
